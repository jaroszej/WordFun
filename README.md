# WordFun
 2018 school project 

 * This program will use the Java Swing Library to create a GUI for an application
 * that kids can use for word-ordering practice. It will display a list of words with
 * two text boxes below the list. The user can type the two best fitting words in the text
 * boxes and the press a Done button. If the user clicks the clear button the words in the
 * text boxes should disappear.
 
 This program served to practice java UI with JFrame.
 It also employs regular expression checks to determine that the typed user inputs are in fact each a word displayed, each not the same word, and that the first word alphabetically comes before the second. 
 
 The program is fairly novice but robust. If I were to make any changes I would use an algorithm to scan through the characters of each element in the wordsArray array to determine the correct alphabetical order of the list of words. This would also enable me, should I choose to do so, to allow for user input of additional custom words.
 Theoretically, this would enable a parent to use this tool to teach their child more thuroughly how to spell, type, and alphabetize words. At the very least, it would help provide variation for any studying this application could be used for for young children.
